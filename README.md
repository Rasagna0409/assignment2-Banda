###### Panipuri
Panipuri is a **Indian snack**, it consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp flatbread), filled with a mixture of **flavored water, tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion or chickpeas**. It is my favourate food because it consists of all **falvours**.
